# Gradle Convention Plugins for My Projects ðŸš€

A reusable set of Gradle convention plugins to streamline the build process for my projects.

## ðŸ“œ Description

This project centralizes the build logic for my Android and Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) projects,
ensuring consistency and reducing boilerplate code in the `build.gradle.kts` files.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Android Application Plugin:** Basic configuration for Android applications.
- **Android Library Plugin:** Basic configuration for Android libraries.
- **Compose Plugin:** Adds Compose-specific dependencies and configurations.
- **Kotlin Multiplatform Plugin:** Adds KMP-specific dependencies and configurations.

## ðŸš€ Usage

To use these plugins, import the desired convention helper and apply it in your module's `build.gradle.kts` file. This provides a cleaner, more readable way to apply conventions.

```kotlin
import io.github.alexanderrotela20.androidLibrary
import io.github.alexanderrotela20.androidLibraryCompose

plugins {
	androidLibrary()
	androidLibraryCompose()
}
```

## ðŸ“¦ Publishing
